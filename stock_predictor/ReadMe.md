# Stock Predictor
Followed the median article https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-price-prediction-based-on-deep-learning-3842ef697da0

Even though I followed the article, I looked at each line of code individually and attempted to understand what was happening. This is also when I figgured out how to connect my gpu to tensorflow. What is qurious is that the forst model, which is relatively small, actually runs faster on a cpu rather then the gpu.

The Jupyter notebook file has it all.
